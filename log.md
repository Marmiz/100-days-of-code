# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repo, created and committed the React - Flux starting kit
files that I have created the past days.

**Thoughts:** Scared that I won't pull this till the end. I hope that this will become an habit sooner
 than my lazyness

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
