# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 02 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repo, created and committed the React - Flux starting kit
files that I have created the past days.

**Thoughts:** Scared that I won't pull this till the end. I hope that this will become an habit sooner
 than my lazyness

### Day 1: January 03 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: After building some component I realized some of my React pakages were deprecated thus throwing me errors. Spent 1 hour fixing and updating.

**Thoughts:** Next time read ALL the docs instead of a single blog page on "how to get started"

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
